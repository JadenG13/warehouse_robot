RUN COMMAND for logging:

rosbag record -O performance_capture.bag /rosout_agg

Ctrl + C to exit


This capture a bag in the root directory /catkin_ws/ which you can then convert to a log file:



More robust than previous version, make sure you use rostobag.py with python3
^ you will need pip install pycryptodomex + pip install python-gnupg


then run logging.py

make sure to point to the log file, update code (path is hardcoded)
